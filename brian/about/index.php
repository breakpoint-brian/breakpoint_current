			<h2><small>Brian works hard and tries not to take himself too seriously. He also loves coastal fishing and is terrible at it.</small></h2>
			<p>What Brian lacks in angling skills and bait choice he more than makes up for in testing skills. A career test engineer,
			he has spent the past 15 years hunting down and landing monster bugs for small and startup companies.</p>
			<h2><small>A little bit more about me. Because you want to know.</small></h2>
			<p>Brian has lived nearly his entire life in Austin. Growing up, Brian spent a lot of time roaming his grandparent's (and other people's)
			acreage in the Texas hill country. He is just as comfortable outside in the middle of nowhere as he is tucked in behind a
			computer screen. Over the years, Brian has developed a specialization in test process and test metrics - a couple of complicated
			labels he uses to sound important and explain that he cares about how tests work and how well they are working.</p>
			<p>When Brian isn't being a nitwit by forgetting to comment his code, eating all the chocolate in the office and showing up
			for work on time everyday, he enjoys never being satisifed with his own work, boston terriers, nearly any game Bethesda makes,
			hanging out with his kids and ruining his wife's diet with awesome food.</p>
